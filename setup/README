## Prerequisites

node (v.6.10+), npm, mongo (v3.4+)

msmtp: for sending e-mails

git-fat: for large binary objects

## Local installation

First of all:
    npm i

Copy the files config/\*.js.dist without .dist extension.
Adjust their content to your liking (especially DB name and user & mail settings).

Then start mongodb service, create a database and user corresponding to the parameters,
and run the mongo script database.js in setup/ folder:
    load("setup/database.js") [from mongo shell]

All should be good now:
    npm start

Note the "student.csv.sample" file in this folder, to test features locally.
